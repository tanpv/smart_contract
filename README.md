Smart Contract
	- externally owned accounts (EOAs) and contract account
	- life cycle of a smart contract
		- write smart contract in high level language
		- compile smart contract to bytecode
		- deploy contract to blockchain by contract creation transaction
		- each deployed contract will be assigned a address
		- contracts only run if they are called by a transaction
	- compiling smart contract with solidity compiler
	- ethereum contract application binary interface
	- select solidity compiler and language version
	- solidity programming
		- data type
		- predefined global variables and functions
			- message call context
			- transaction context
			- block context
		- address object
		- build in function
		- contract definition
			- interface
			- library
			- function
		- contract constructor and self destruct
		- function modifiers
		- contract inheritance
		- error handling
		- events
		- catching events
		- calling other contracts
		- creating a new instance
